# ‚úÖ Workload Identity Federation Setup Complete

## What Was Successfully Configured

### üîê Staging Environment (staging-adk)
- **Workload Identity Pool**: `github-pool`
- **WIF Provider**: `projects/454188184539/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/github-pool/providers/github-provider`
- **Service Account**: `github-actions@staging-adk.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- **Repository Access**: Restricted to `Michaelktker/my-agentic-rag`

### üîê Production Environment (production-adk)
- **Workload Identity Pool**: `github-pool`
- **WIF Provider**: `projects/638797485217/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/github-pool/providers/github-provider`
- **Service Account**: `github-actions@production-adk.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- **Repository Access**: Restricted to `Michaelktker/my-agentic-rag`

### üõ°Ô∏è Permissions Granted
Both service accounts have been granted:
- Cloud Build Editor
- Cloud Run Admin
- Storage Admin
- All necessary permissions for deployment

## üìã Next Steps (Manual Setup Required)

### 1. Configure GitHub Repository Secrets
Since we need GitHub authentication, please add these secrets manually in your repository:

**Go to**: `https://github.com/Michaelktker/my-agentic-rag/settings/secrets/actions`

**Add these secrets:**

```
WIF_PROVIDER: projects/454188184539/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/github-pool/providers/github-provider
WIF_SERVICE_ACCOUNT: github-actions@staging-adk.iam.gserviceaccount.com
WIF_PROVIDER_PROD: projects/638797485217/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/github-pool/providers/github-provider
WIF_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PROD: github-actions@production-adk.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

### 2. Configure GitHub Environments
Create these environments in your repository settings:

**Go to**: `https://github.com/Michaelktker/my-agentic-rag/settings/environments`

**Create environments:**
- `production-approval` (with required reviewers)
- `production` (for production deployment)

### 3. Test the Workflow
Once the secrets and environments are configured:
1. Push a small change to the `main` branch
2. Watch the staging deployment trigger automatically
3. For production deployment, manually trigger the production workflow

## üöÄ Your Automated Pipeline is Ready!

‚úÖ Workload Identity Federation configured
‚úÖ Service accounts created with proper permissions
‚úÖ GitHub Actions workflows ready
‚úÖ Cloud Build configurations prepared
‚úÖ Environment-specific configurations set

Just add the GitHub secrets and environments, then you'll have a fully automated CI/CD pipeline!
